#This website is a very basic search engine to find gifs via an api from the Giphy website.

#User inputs a search term into the search field and clicks on the "go" button.

#Future Improvements Suggested:  Activate "sign-up" and "log-in" buttons, increase number of items/gifs returned from search query.
